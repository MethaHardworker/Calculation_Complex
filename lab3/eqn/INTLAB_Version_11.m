%Help file for INTLAB Version 11
%
%Some corrections, adaptations and many improvements.
%
%Main new feature: The ODE toolbox consisting of a Matlab/Octave implementation
%  of Lohner's AWA and a Taylor model toolbox. 
%
%The ODE toolbox is entirely implemented by Florian Buenger. He spent 
%  very much effort to fight Matlab/Octave's interpretation overhead, and
%  with quite some success.
%
%In particular he wrote an operator-free interval toolbox "iv" to avoid the
%  significant time penalty when using Matlab's operator concept.
%
%Moreover, non-smmoth functions min and max are added to Algorithmic
%  Differentiation, see e.g. the famous half-pipe function in the demo
%  dglobal.
